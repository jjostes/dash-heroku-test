# dash-heroku-test
Using someone else's dash app tutorial in order to troubleshoot my own app

### Purpose
When deploying my dash app Pew-Data-Deep-Dive to heroku, I was receiving errors in the log that certain dependencies could not be loaded. I will use this test app to see if the same issues arise while attempting to deploy in order to determine what needs to be fixed in my original project. So it goes.
